What is it?
--------------

A fun puzzle game! On a 9x9 board of tiles, find "haps". A hap has all three of the following:

- The background colour of all three tiles are the same or all different.
- The image on all three tiles are all the same or all different.
- The colour of the image on all three tiles are all the same or all different.

Scoring
--------------

The player will get 1 point for every correct hap found and -1 point for every incorrect hap or already discovered hap that they find. When the player believes there are no haps left they will click the "gyul" button. If they are correct, they will get three points. If not, they will get -1 points.
